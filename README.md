# Air Quality Forecasting Report

## Introduction

This report details the process of forecasting PM2.5 air pollution levels in Beijing using historical air quality and meteorological data. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting. Accurate PM2.5 predictions can aid in public health and environmental management. Our approach involves data exploration, preprocessing, LSTM model design, experimentation with hyperparameters, and evaluation of the model's performance.
